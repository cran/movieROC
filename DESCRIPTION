Description: Visualization of decision rules for binary classification and Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve estimation under different generalizations:
  - making the classification subsets flexible to cover those scenarios where both extremes of the
  marker are associated with a higher risk of being positive, considering two thresholds 
  (gROC curve);
  - transforming the marker by a function either defined by the user or resulting from a logistic 
  regression model (hROC curve);
  - considering a linear transformation with some fixed parameters introduced by the user, 
  dynamic parameters or empirically maximizing TPR for each FPR for a bivariate marker.
  Also a quadratic transformation with particular coefficients or a function fitted by a logistic 
  regression model can be considered (biROC curve);
  - considering a linear transformation with some fixed parameters introduced by the user, 
  dynamic parameters or a function fitted by a logistic regression model (multiROC curve).
  The classification regions behind each point of the ROC curve are displayed in both fixed 
  graphics (plot.buildROC(), plot.regions() or plot.funregions() function) or videos (movieROC() 
  function).
