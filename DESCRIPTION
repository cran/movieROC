Description: Visualization of decision rules for binary classification and Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve estimation under different generalizations proposed in the literature:
  - making the classification subsets flexible to cover those scenarios where both extremes of the
  marker are associated with a higher risk of being positive, considering two thresholds 
  (gROC() function);
  - transforming the marker by a proper function trying to improve the classification performance 
  (hROC() function);
  - when dealing with multivariate markers, considering a proper transformation to univariate space 
  trying to maximize the resulting AUC of the TPR for each FPR (multiROC() function).
  The classification regions behind each point of the ROC curve are displayed in both static 
  graphics (plot_buildROC(), plot_regions() or plot_funregions() function) or 
  videos (movieROC() function).
